### Project Name: UFC Event Planner

#### Objective: To develop a user-friendly web application that allows UFC fans to plan and enhance their fight night experiences. Users can create events, invite friends, vote on fights, and integrate food and drink ordering services. The application provides real-time updates on UFC events, access to social media content, betting odds, and information on where to watch the fights.

#### Technology Stack and Skills
##### Frontend (UI/UX):
###### JavaScript: Essential for interactive elements and dynamic content manipulation.
###### React.js: A modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications that require a responsive and dynamic user experience.
###### HTML5 and CSS3: For structuring and styling web pages, ensuring they are visually appealing and functionally effective.
###### Sass or LESS: CSS preprocessors that make managing complex stylesheets easier.
###### Figma: For designing and prototyping the UI/UX. Figma will be used to create comprehensive wireframes and design prototypes before coding.
###### Responsive Design: Techniques and practices to ensure the app looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
###### Accessibility (a11y): Ensuring that the app is usable for people with disabilities, which may involve adhering to WCAG guidelines.
##### Backend:
###### Node.js: A server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications.
###### Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.
###### MongoDB: A NoSQL database, used for its flexibility with document schemas and efficiency in handling large volumes of data.
#### APIs:
###### UFC API: For retrieving fight schedules, event details, and other relevant content.
###### Social Media APIs (Twitter, Instagram): To fetch and display content related to UFC events and engage with social media directly from the app.
###### Google Maps API: For locating bars and restaurants broadcasting the fights.
###### Food Delivery APIs (UberEats, DoorDash): For ordering food and drinks directly through the application.
#### Modern and Desired Skills for Frontend/UI/UX Development:
###### UX Research: Understanding user behavior, needs, and motivations through observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methodologies.
###### Prototyping and Wireframing: Skills in using tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD to design both low and high-fidelity prototypes.
###### Visual Design: Knowledge of design principles like color theory, typography, and layout principles to create aesthetically pleasing interfaces.
###### Interactive Design: Ability to design interactive animations and transitions that enhance the user experience.
###### Frontend Frameworks: Proficiency in frontend frameworks like React.js or Angular.js is highly valued for creating responsive and efficient applications.
###### Performance Optimization: Techniques to ensure that web applications are optimized for speed and efficiency.
###### SEO Basics: Understanding of basic SEO principles to ensure that the application is discoverable and ranks well on search engines.
